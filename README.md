# Options Trading Simulation Project

This project simulates a banking system that offers clients the ability to engage in options trading. It focuses on relational database modeling, stored procedures for financial computations, the implementation of triggers, and a comprehensive decision-making process for options trading.

## Project Overview

This project aims to simulate a banking system in PostgreSQL that enables clients to engage in options trading. It combines financial knowledge with database management skills, challenging the developer to construct a comprehensive, data-driven decision-making system in a simulated banking environment.

## Database Modelization

- The `model.sql` file contains the SQL scripts for creating the database schema, including tables for clients, wallets, options, stocks, and historical stock price data.

## Monte Carlo Simulation

- The `monte_carlo.sql` file implements a stored procedure for Monte Carlo simulation to calculate option prices.
- Test cases in the same file demonstrate the functionality of the Monte Carlo simulation.

## Black-Scholes Computation

- The `black_schole.sql` file contains a stored procedure to compute option prices using the Black-Scholes formula.
- Test cases in the same file validate the functionality of the Black-Scholes computation.

## Creation of a View for Option Prices

- The `client_stock_view.sql` file develops a consolidated view displaying option prices for each (client, stock) pair, combining Monte Carlo and Black-Scholes prices.
- Sample queries in the same file demonstrate the usage of the created view.

## Triggers and Stored Procedure Updates

- The `triggers.sql` file implements triggers to automate the update of option prices upon changes in stock prices or client data.
- Test cases validate the functionality of triggers and updated stored procedures.

## Decision-Making Process

- The `Decision_Making/` directory contains scripts related to the decision-making process for options trading.
- Various files cover option ranking, decision logic for buying and exercising options, client portfolio management, and financial dashboards.

## Difficulties Faced

During the development of this project, several challenges were encountered:

1. **Complex Financial Models:** Implementing the accurate financial models (Monte Carlo simulations and Black-Scholes computations).

2. **Integration of Decision-Making Logic:** Developing a decision-making process involved considering numerous factors, including market volatility, risk tolerance, and client portfolio management, which was very complex to do in exercise 6. We tried to do it but it still didn't work after a lot of testing. 

3. **Triggers and Transactions:** Ensuring the correct functioning of triggers and updating stored procedures while maintaining data integrity posed few issues in handling transactions.
